                For as long as people have been farming, natural, organic methods were the norm.

                But during the last century, the rise of chemical-based agriculture has dramatically changed the way we produce our food. Increasingly corporate and mechanized, today's conventional farms are saturated with artificial fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides that are engineered to reduce the burden of labor while keeping crop yields high.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                However, we have failed to recognize the unintended consequences of conventional, chemical-based farming practices. Soil health degradation, loss of organic matter and erosion, as well as water pollution, toxic residues in our food supply, and lack of biodiversity— to name a few.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                We have also failed to recognize what is at stake. If we continue on this path, there will soon come a time when our soil gives out and we will be unable to feed our children and grandchildren.
              </p>
        
              <p>
                Thankfully, despite these very real dangers, positive transformation is possible. Since 1947, Rodale Institute has taken the lead to promote a better, natural, and more responsible way of modern farming by conducting research into the cultivation of healthy, living soils. Way back then we called this approach “organic”—and an entire movement was born.
